# Agent NERV - Tutorial Master NPC

An AI Agent NPC that acts as an intelligent tutorial master, teaching users how to use web applications through natural conversation. This agent demonstrates core AI agent capabilities: **Tool Use**, **Planning**, **Memory**, and **Reasoning**.

## Overview

Agent NERV is a specialized AI agent designed to guide users through learning new applications. Unlike static tutorials, this agent:

- **Adapts** to each user's learning pace and style
- **Remembers** what you've already learned
- **Plans** the optimal teaching sequence
- **Explains** the reasoning behind features and workflows

## Core Features

### Tool Use
The agent can interact with applications to check user progress, monitor app state, and trigger UI highlights to guide users.

### Planning
Intelligently plans tutorial sequences based on user familiarity and progress, adapting the teaching pace in real-time.

### Memory
Remembers what users have learned, tracks mastery levels, and builds a personalized teaching history.

### Reasoning
Explains why features work the way they do, shows connections between concepts, and provides context for better understanding.

## Tech Stack

- **Backend**: Node.js 18+, TypeScript, Express.js, direct LLM API integration
- **Frontend**: HTML/JavaScript or React
- **AI**: OpenAI API / Anthropic Claude / Ollama
